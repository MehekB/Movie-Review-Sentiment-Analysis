# Movie-Review-Sentiment-Analysis

## Overview

**Movie Review Sentiment Analyzer** is a Python-based tool that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to analyze user reviews of movies and generate a sentiment-based rating. By integrating with the TMDB API, the tool fetches movie reviews and applies a Naive Bayes classifier to determine the overall sentimentâ€”positive, negative, or neutral. This project showcases advanced data analysis techniques and demonstrates the practical application of machine learning algorithms in understanding user sentiment.

## Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Uses a Naive Bayes classifier to accurately predict the sentiment of movie reviews.
- **TMDB API Integration**: Fetches movie data and reviews.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, the tool offers a clean and intuitive interface for users to analyze movie sentiment easily.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Presents sentiment analysis results in an easy-to-understand format using charts and graphs.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Allows users to adjust the threshold for sentiment classification, providing flexibility in how sentiment is defined.
